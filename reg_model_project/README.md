About the Course

This course introduces simple and multiple linear regression models. These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio.

- About Linear Regression and Modeling
This short module introduces basics about Coursera specializations and courses in general, this specialization: Statistics with R, and this course: Linear Regression and Modeling. Please take several minutes to browse them through. Thanks for joining us in this course!

- Linear Regression
In this week we’ll introduce linear regression. Many of you may be familiar with regression from reading the news, where graphs with straight lines are overlaid on scatterplots. Linear models can be used for prediction or to evaluate whether there is a linear relationship between two numerical variables.

- More about Linear Regression
Welcome to week 2! In this week, we will look at outliers, inference in linear regression and variability partitioning. Please use this week to strengthen your understanding on linear regression. Don't forget to post your questions, concerns and suggestions in the discussion forum!

- Multiple Regression
In this week, we’ll explore multiple regression, which allows us to model numerical response variables using multiple predictors (numerical and categorical). We will also cover inference for multiple linear regression, model selection, and model diagnostics. Hope you enjoy!

- Final Project
In this week you will use the data set provided to complete and report on a data analysis question. Please read the background information, review the report template (downloaded from the link in Lesson Project Information), and then complete the peer review assignment.
